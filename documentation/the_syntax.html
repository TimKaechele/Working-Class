<h1>The Syntax</h1>

<h2>Express yourself</h2>

<p>WorkingClass is about readability. So we tried to make it as expressive as
possible.</p>

<p>Well first of all: a tasklist needs a name, without a name a tasklist would be
nothing. Never forget it. If you write a tasklist without a name you will produce
a gigantic error message. Just sayin.</p>

<p>Anyways, everything else is completely optional. Hurra.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist name
---
[ ] an example task
</code></pre>

<h2>Just do it.</h2>

<p>A tasklist is nothing without the ability to finish a task. We tried to make it
as human readable and easy to use as possible.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[ ] An unfinished task
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to write an unfinished task without the space between the
brackets.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[] An unfinished task
</code></pre>

<p>However, we recommed the <code>[ ]</code> syntax, it looks much nicer.</p>

<p>Of course you have to get things done. WorkingClass recognizes any
non-whitespace character between the brackets as a finished task.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[x] Look I finished something

[X] I am also finished.

[y] Me too

[✔︎] I am so fancy
</code></pre>

<h2>All tasks are equal, but some tasks are more equal.</h2>

<p>Give tasks priority. Just add a <code>!</code> in front of a task.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
![ ] A very important task

[ ] A normal task
</code></pre>

<h2>It&rsquo;s about time.</h2>

<p>Most tasks have a due date. WorkingClass allows to add dates to a task by
writing the date in the format <code>d(d).m(m).yy(yy)</code> in curly brackets</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
![ ]{13.12.15} Finish it.

[ ]{3.05.15} Website.
</code></pre>

<h2>I am going to remember that.</h2>

<p>So now we know how to write simple tasks with a due date. But well, we are humans,
we forget things, so it would be nice to have a reminder, rightt? Right!</p>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> The WorkingClass doesn&rsquo;t come with a system to deliver notifications
or reminders, it just allows to specify one, it won&rsquo;t send an email or a
push notification to your smartphone.</p>

<p>There are basically two basic ways to specify a reminder.</p>

<h3>Keep it relative.</h3>

<p>If your task comes with a due date and you want to be notified one day ahead
you can simply write it like this.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[ ]{13.12.2015}(-1) A very important task with a reminder
</code></pre>

<p>This will remind you one day ahead. The parser comes with some configurations to
set a standard time, without any adjustments the parser defaults every reminder
without a time to 9:00am, but you can configure this.</p>

<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to be reminded 9:00am, then you can write a reminder
like this.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[ ]{13.12.2015}(-2 9:30) A very important task with a reminder 2 days ahead
</code></pre>

<h3>Absolutism at its finest</h3>

<p>Well, relative reminders may be quite stylish and awesome, but they are not
always very handy. In those moments you can write it also with an absolute date
This is very handy if your task doesn&rsquo;t come with a due date and you still want
to have a reminder.</p>

<p>The same thing as with relative reminders: if you don&rsquo;t specify a time, the parser
defaults to 9:00am.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>My Tasklist
---
[ ](12.12.15) REMIND ME.
[ ](22.5.15 15:00) That thing.
</code></pre>
